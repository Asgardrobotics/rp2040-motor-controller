# rp2040-motor-controller
A dual channel brushless motor controller based on the RP2040 microcontroller

The entire board is the size of a credit card, and is designed to be fabbed using the JLCPCB assembly service.

Our dream is that you will fab your own boards, make changes, and share your work - giving this design life beyond our efforts.

Designed by Taylor Alexander for Twisted Fields, for the Acorn Precision Farming Rover.
